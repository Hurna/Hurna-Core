# Simple-Hybesis-Algorithms
Educational demonstration of building simple algorithms under good practices development (cross-building, unit testing, ...)

# CMake - Cross-Building
The building relies on CMake, an Open-Source system that allows to easily build cross-platform applications by generating native makefiles (cf. http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html).

The current compilation has been fully tested under Win 7 (VS 11 x86/x64) and gcc.

## CMake - GTest - Unit Testing
Use the CMake 'BUILD_TESTING' option to automatically setup Unit Testing with google test.
It allows to very quickly get set up with C++ and google test:

- Clone GTest via GIT
- Setup the Unit Testings
- Compile GTest at build time

# Getting Started
## Build using CMake-GUI:

    Run CMake-GUI
    Select source/target directory
    Click on Configure the project
    Click on Generate the Solution files
    Open the solution file (if MSVC) and build or use make command.

## Build in Command-Line (UNIX):

    mkdir Simple-Hybesis-Algorithms-Build (Create Build directory)
    cd Simple-Hybesis-Algorithms-Build    (Open build director)
    ccmake ../Simple-Hybesis-Algorithms   (Configure the make given Source repository)
    make                                  (Make command, use -j parameter to use multi-core)

## Run the tests:

The 'BUILD_TESTING' option will create executables that can be run directly from build directory.

E.g. to manually run the 'TestBasicSearch' Unit Test (using GTest):

    Simple-Hybesis-Algorithms-Build/Modules/Array/Testing/Debug/TestBasicSearch.exe  (Win)
    ./Simple-Hybesis-Algorithms-Build/Modules/Array/Testing/Debug/TestBasicSearch    (UNIX)
